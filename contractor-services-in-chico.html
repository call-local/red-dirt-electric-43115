They let me watch each step of the diagnostics and explained where the issue was occurring, answering all of my questions and even vacuumed up after the repair was complete! Helpful and informative, they gave me a workup for future maintenance work on my panel, and even gave an solution estimate for the tangle of wires hanging from my wall mounted TV. No pressure, pleasant and speedy. I will be calling them for all of my future electric needs.",

Every interaction was more than pleasant- Tom completed the work on the property.  He was communicative, calling partway through the job to provide updates, explaining all work in detail and in an understandable way. He was willing to be available, even on the weekend, to ensure that my tenants had electricity. He was just an overall joy to talk to. Menan helped process payment and schedule and was understanding and respectful as I navigated finding the right time to book. Every interaction with this company left me wondering where these nice people came from! I will definitely be recommending them to anyone I know that needs an electrician and I will call them again should another need occur.",

      "reviewBody": "Red Dirt is a classy organization. Let me explain - classy means treatment of people, being reasonable regarding price and the quality of work.\nRed Dirt excels in each. From owner to office staff to contractor doing the work (there is some overlap), I was treated with patience, fairness, flexibility - and they’re all friendly. That’s a lot of f-words…\nIn seriousness, this is what we miss about small companies who remember what things are like before becoming massive and too busy for all the details.\nThe job I needed done was to prevent my home insurance being cancelled. That would’ve meant a new company with a much higher premium. It was stressful; the insurance company mandated the job be done by a licensed electrician. With proof. I chose Red Dirt because they’re from Paradise, where I grew up and I happen to understand the name.\n\nLiam from Red Dirt came to my house (on the weekend, no less) and talked to me, gave me options, explained what they’d do and then they did it.\nThey had the obstacle of being at the mercy of both PG&E and the City of Chico’s time scheduling (they tell you when they’ll make it to you) and Red Dirt got the job done before my deadline.\n\nThere was minor construction required to make it look nice (not in the estimate) and the cost was waived.\nI got to keep my insurance without a price increase, the poor craftsmanship and outdated wiring in my electrical panel is now updated and new…\nI didn’t even have to increase the dose of my anxiety medication!\nI’m half-joking.\nBill, Liam, Mennen and Tom - good people. Hard, capable workers.\n\nSchedule what you need help with. If you see a company with eight different trucks and a half dozen billboards, chances are you will receive a different kind of experience.\n\nThanks, Red Dirt\n\n- Brett in Chico",

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Fantastic service! Great electricians solved a long standing wiring issue within minutes. They let me watch each step of the diagnostics and explained where the issue was occurring, answering all of my questions and even vacuumed up after the repair was complete! Helpful and informative, they gave me a workup for future maintenance work on my panel, and even gave an solution estimate for the tangle of wires hanging from my wall mounted TV. No pressure, pleasant and speedy. I will be calling them for all of my future electric needs.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">After repairs, electricity seems to be working appropriately! However, this review is more aimed at the quality of people that work here. Every interaction was more than pleasant- Tom completed the work on the property.  He was communicative, calling partway through the job to provide updates, explaining all work in detail and in an understandable way. He was willing to be available, even on the weekend, to ensure that my tenants had electricity. He was just an overall joy to talk to. Menan helped process payment and schedule and was understanding and respectful as I navigated finding the right time to book. Every interaction with this company left me wondering where these nice people came from! I will definitely be recommending them to anyone I know that needs an electrician and I will call them again should another need occur.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Red Dirt is a classy organization. Let me explain - classy means treatment of people, being reasonable regarding price and the quality of work.
Red Dirt excels in each. From owner to office staff to contractor doing the work (there is some overlap), I was treated with patience, fairness, flexibility - and they’re all friendly. That’s a lot of f-words…
In seriousness, this is what we miss about small companies who remember what things are like before becoming massive and too busy for all the details.
The job I needed done was to prevent my home insurance being cancelled. That would’ve meant a new company with a much higher premium. It was stressful; the insurance company mandated the job be done by a licensed electrician. With proof. I chose Red Dirt because they’re from Paradise, where I grew up and I happen to understand the name.

Liam from Red Dirt came to my house (on the weekend, no less) and talked to me, gave me options, explained what they’d do and then they did it.
They had the obstacle of being at the mercy of both PG&E and the City of Chico’s time scheduling (they tell you when they’ll make it to you) and Red Dirt got the job done before my deadline.

There was minor construction required to make it look nice (not in the estimate) and the cost was waived.
I got to keep my insurance without a price increase, the poor craftsmanship and outdated wiring in my electrical panel is now updated and new…
I didn’t even have to increase the dose of my anxiety medication!
I’m half-joking.
Bill, Liam, Mennen and Tom - good people. Hard, capable workers.

Schedule what you need help with. If you see a company with eight different trucks and a half dozen billboards, chances are you will receive a different kind of experience.

Thanks, Red Dirt

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Last year Red Dirt Electric install exterior outlets on my home so i could plug my Christmas decor in.
This year I hired them again to wire my garage with electrical outlets, switches, and install lights. When I walk into the garage the lights come on instantly. No more dark corners. I would hire them again in a minute. They show up on time with big smiles. They are friendly and very knowledgeable in their craft.  Hire them and get a great experience.</div>
